You have 6 lives, represented by the 6 Avenger inserts in the middle of the playfield, and each insert corresponds to their respective shot. Each Avenger has a health bar; if the health bar reaches 0%, the Avenger will tap out and be replaced by a new one. The health bar decreases through various factors:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Depleting the number of given flips on the display<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Timer reaching 0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Draining a ball (deals a ton of damage)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The members of the Black Order are represented by all of the shots being lit, and clearing waves of shots will defeat members. The longer you keep an Avenger alive, the more points you get for successful attacks and the more bonus points you\u2019ll score.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The supporting characters also have roles in the mode; making their shots will give you some helpful perks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Drop targets &#8211; Summons Vision to add 8 flips, reducing the chance of damage being taken.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Disc &#8211; Spelling STRANGE lights a rotating Power-Up insert for 3x damage, 4x if there\u2019s also an arrow shot on there. Times out after 10 seconds but can be reactivated with another spin. More spins move the power up around.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Captain Marvel &#8211; Freezes the timer for a short time, reducing the chance of damage being taken from time running out.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Hawkeye &#8211; Shooting the upper loop will light the three shots on the left for an attack. If you shoot an already lit arrow this way it\u2019ll count as 2 attacks for the price of one.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Antman &#8211; Deals damage the first time (ie. a normal shot during the mode). The second time, summons Wasp to add another ball into play, multiplying all scores and damage by 2x.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">If you defeat the Black Order, you are awarded a bonus based on remaining Avengers (20M per Avenger), remaining flips (1M per flip), and remaining time (1M per second remaining).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"photo-competition-giveaway\">Photo Competition Give-Away!<\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Can\u2019t make it on Saturday afternoon?<\/strong> No worries!
