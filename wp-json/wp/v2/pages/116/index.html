This is where the excitement of competition meets the joy of pinball. Our leaderboard showcases the top pinball players in Tasmania, tracking their journey as they flip their way to the top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How It Works<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our leaderboard is powered by the points system of the International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA). As players participate in IFPA-endorsed events within the state, they earn IFPA points based on their performance. These points determine their ranking on our state leaderboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Leaderboard [To Be Launched]<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> The leaderboard is currently under development. Once live, it will display the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Player Rankings:<\/strong> A list of players ranked by their IFPA points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>State Final Cutoff:<\/strong> An indication of the current cutoff line for qualifying for the state finals. This line represents the threshold players must cross to be eligible for these prestigious events.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Player Profiles:<\/strong> Brief profiles of the top-ranked players, showcasing their achievements and contributions to the TAPP community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keeping Up with the Competition<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for the launch of our live leaderboard. It will be updated regularly to reflect the latest standings, providing an up-to-date snapshot of the competitive landscape in Tasmanian pinball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join the Fun!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget, every game of pinball at our endorsed events is a chance to earn points and climb the leaderboard. Whether you&#8217;re aiming for the top spot or just looking to improve your personal best, we encourage everyone to participate and enjoy the spirit of friendly competition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Thrill of the Leaderboard Welcome to the Tasmanian Association of Pinball Players&#8217; (TAPP) Leaderboard!
