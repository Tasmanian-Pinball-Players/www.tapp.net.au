At TAPP, our passion for pinball goes beyond just playing; we&#8217;re committed to fostering a vibrant community where players of all levels can come together, compete, and grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our Mission<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission is to establish regular pinball competitions throughout Tasmania, offering both casual and competitive environments for players. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned player honing your skills or a newcomer eager to learn, TAPP provides the perfect platform to engage with the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Regular Competitions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to our activities are our regular pinball competitions. Held fortnightly, these events are designed to be fun, inclusive, and competitive. They provide an opportunity for players to challenge themselves, climb the rankings, and prepare for larger tournaments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Part of the Australian Championship Series<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TAPP is proud to be a part of the Australian Championship Series (ACS). This involvement means our events aren&#8217;t just local competitions; they&#8217;re stepping stones to regional and national recognition. By participating in our events, players can earn points towards their standings in the ACS, opening doors to state finals and potentially national and international levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Community of Pinball Enthusiasts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the flippers and silver balls, TAPP is about building a community. We&#8217;re a group of enthusiasts who share a love for pinball and believe in its potential to bring people together. From sharing tips and strategies to cheering each other on during competitions, our community is the heart of TAPP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join Us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We invite you to be a part of TAPP, whether as a competitor in our tournaments, a volunteer helping to organise events, or a supporter cheering from the sidelines.
