It&#8217;s a prestigious tournament series that brings together the top pinball players from across Australia. Participants in the ACS compete for the honor of being named the Australian Pinball Champion, along with a chance to represent Australia in the IFPA World Pinball Championship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our Events and the Points System<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Tasmanian Association of Pinball Players (TAPP), many of our events are officially sanctioned by the IFPA. This means participants in our events can earn IFPA points, contributing to their national and international ranking. These points are crucial for those aiming to qualify for the state finals in the ACS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep it Fun and Simple<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand that the IFPA points system and the details of competitive play can seem complex, especially for newcomers. But don&#8217;t worry \u2013 you don&#8217;t need to be an expert in the system to participate in our events. The most important thing is to come and have fun!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TAPP events, all you need to do is focus on enjoying the game of pinball. We&#8217;ll take care of recording your results and updating your IFPA rankings. Over time, as you participate more, you&#8217;ll naturally become more familiar with how it all works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">State Rankings and Qualifying for State Finals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to the excitement, we will be maintaining a <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/leaderboard\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"116\">leaderboard<\/a> showcasing the current state rankings of TAPP participants. This will give everyone a clear view of how they&#8217;re performing in the run-up to the state finals. The leaderboard will also indicate the cut-off line for qualifying, making it easy to see who&#8217;s in the running to compete in these prestigious events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for updates, and remember: every game counts!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How State, National, and International Finals Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>State Finals:<\/strong> Players accumulate IFPA points through various endorsed events throughout the year.
